# AImprov: Yes, And...

A collaborative storytelling game where players‚Äîhuman or AI‚Äîbuild a wild, unpredictable narrative one sentence at a time, powered by multiple LLMs (Hugging Face) and optional image generation for vivid story visuals.

## ‚ú® What‚Äôs This All About?
Inspired by improv comedy‚Äôs ‚ÄúYes, And‚Ä¶‚Äù rule, AImprov lets you assemble a cast of quirky AI personalities (like a neurotic Jerry Seinfeld or a swashbuckling Pirate Captain) alongside human players. Each player adds a sentence to the story, with AI contributions generated by distinct LLMs (e.g., Llama, Mixtral) via Hugging Face‚Äôs Inference API. Optional image generation (via Stable Diffusion) creates visuals for each turn. At the end, an AI editor weaves it all into a cohesive first-person tale. Perfect for creative writing, party games, or laughing at absurd AI-driven plot twists!
